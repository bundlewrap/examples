# List of community-maintained repos and bundles

This is a collection of public BundleWrap repositories. These repos are used by organizations or individuals for their own purposes, but may serve as inspiration for your own bundles and such.

If you maintain a public repo, feel free to open a pull request and add your URL.

**These repositories are community-maintained and not subject to any review or endorsed by the core BundleWrap developers. Be cautious when using other people's code.**
